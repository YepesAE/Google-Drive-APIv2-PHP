Functions for Foogle Drive API v2 in PHP

## How to use
After setting the Google Drive API in your own project, simply add the .php file anywhere and edit the "path/to/autoload" to where your autoload is.

## Notes
This API uses linear functions for searching specific files, so if you're going to be working with a large amount of files and folders, the API could take a really long time for a simple request.
